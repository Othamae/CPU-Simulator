# CPU-Simulator

## Portfolio Project CS104: Computer Architecture! 

The idea of this project is to design and implement a working Python program that simulates the inner workings of a CPU.

#### Project Objetives:

- Create classes that mimic the functionalities of a CPU, cache, and memory bus.
- Fetch and parse instructions from an input file.
- Fetch and parse initialization values for the Memory Bus from a separate input file.
- Send CPU instructions and initial Memory Bus values to the CPU and Memory Bus, respectively.
- Provide console output to the user documenting the stages of input processing.
